# Reorganized

The app for staying organized.

In the information age, with the constant influx of new information, it's easy to miss out on essential things, forget to bookmark important websites, and lose track of items we've borrowed or lent.

To solve this problem, the application stores the data from our daily lives permanently in an app, making it easily retrievable. And, unlike traditional diary journaling, this app provides a more efficient way to search, analyze, and accumulate activities at any time.
